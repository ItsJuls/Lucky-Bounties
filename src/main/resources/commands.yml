# ==EVENT COMMANDS
# since some people wanted comamnds when people do stuff, I moved this into a seperate config file. You can disable each command by simply
# having only one empty string in the list (like shown below):
#
# kill-without-bounty-penalty:
#   - ""
#
# This will disable the command


#PARAMS: [KILLER] [KILLED]
kill-without-bounty-penalty:
  - "say &c[KILLER] you have killed an innocent!"   #Executes commands when someone kills a person without bounties

#PARAMS: [TARGET] [SETTER] [AMOUNT] [ITEM]
on-set-bounty:
  - ""

#PARAMS: [TARGET] [SETTER] [AMOUNT]
on-set-eco-bounty:
  - ""
